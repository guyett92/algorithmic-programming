# Algorithmic Programming
A collection of JavScript algorithms that I have made.
## Sorts
Various sorting algorithms.
### Bubble Sort
* The inefficient bubble sort should not be used.
* Best Case: Ω(N)
* Average Case: Θ(N^2)
* Worst Case: O(N^2)
* Space: O(1)
* Stable
* Comparison Sort
* [Bubble Sort](bubbleSort/script.js)
### Insertion Sort
* Insertion sort is a way to insert something where it is supposed to go. Also inefficient.
* Best Case: Ω(N)
* Average Case: Θ(N^2)
* Worst Case: O(N^2)
* Space: O(1)
* Stable
* Comparison Sort
* [Insertion Sort](insertionSort/script.js)
